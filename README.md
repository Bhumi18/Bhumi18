# Bhumi Sadariya

## 👋 About Me
Hi! I’m Bhumi — a curious and driven developer with a strong foundation in both full-stack and blockchain development. Over the past few years, I’ve worked across the entire development lifecycle — from building responsive web applications with React and Node.js to writing secure smart contracts on EVM-compatible chains.

I enjoy diving deep into how systems work — whether it's designing scalable backend services, integrating APIs with frontends, or deploying decentralized apps. I'm comfortable working across the stack, from backend logic and databases to frontend integration and blockchain interactions.

Alongside development, I’ve gained hands-on experience with DevOps practices like CI/CD automation and managing cloud infrastructure to support smooth and reliable delivery.

I'm passionate about solving real-world problems through performant, user-focused software — across both Web2 and Web3 ecosystems.
